                    The Helios 300 drops you right into the game with everything you need to obliterate the opposition on a blisteringly fast 240Hz1 /3ms2 display. Only now, we’ve armed it with an NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 30601, a 10th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 Mobile Processor1 and our custom-engineered 4th Gen AeroBlade™ 3D Technology.

                   NVIDIA® GEFORCE RTX™ 30 SERIES
                

                   These GPUs deliver the ultimate performance for gamers and creators. They’re powered by NVIDIA’s 2nd Gen RTX Ampere architecture – with new Ray Tracing Cores, Tensor Cores, and streaming multiprocessors for a huge leap in performance.
                












3RD GEN TENSOR CORES
Tensor Cores enable mixed-precision computing, dynamically adapting calculations to accelerate throughput while preserving accuracy.



2ND GEN RT CORESRay tracing simulates the true behavior of light to bring real-time, cinematic quality rendering to the most visually intense games.

                   4TH GEN AEROBLADE™ 3D TECHNOLOGY
                

                    All Predator laptops utilize our custom-engineered cooling technology. The latest generation’s new design reduces noise while increasing airflow – allowing you to maximize your performance, no matter the task. And when the going gets hot, Predator CoolBoost™ gets going. Fan speeds increase based on generated heat, keeping critical areas continually cooled.
                












BIONIC DESIGN
Inspired by silent, powerful owl flight mechanics we gave our fans a serrated edge, allowing more air to pass through.



ULTRA-THIN BLADESEach of the 59 bionic blades is just 0.1mm thick and all-metal with a stabilizing dual indent groove.



NOISE-REDUCTIONWinglets along the top and bottom fan edge and a curved fin along the inner blade further reduce turbulence.












                   MAKE YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN
                

                   Your gaming laptop’s style should match your own – with a look that says, “Start the match! I’m ready!” So that when the black, metal-clad3 machine flares into life, filling the 17-inch1 screen of the display with lurid colors, let it remind them that you know only one path: victory.
                












                   ONE SPEED: FAST
                

                  Speed is at the core of this laptop with the display leading the charge. How? We’ve chosen a 240Hz1 panel with a 3ms overdrive response time. Farewell blur and hello clear, crisp high-octane gameplay.
